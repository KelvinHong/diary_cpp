<New Experiences>

    Today records my new work experience in XY Company.
It is a leading company in AI research and Computer Vision.
I've studied so hard to be accepted into the company, 
and I hope it would become a great experiences for me.
What, Imposter Syndrome? 
Well, I kind of have it, because I thought I might act like a stupid man in front of them,
but I should accept this kind of emotion and move on, 
because I know I'm improving each day.
I hope one day I can become a great researcher on the AI field.
(Don't take my words seriously, these words are just placeholder.)
(Or are they not? who knows)
   
Testing appending mode.....
Done.
